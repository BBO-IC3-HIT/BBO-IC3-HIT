    inform their custodian and customers of this “letter of credit” and
    “legal proceedings” which has been missing in the Edgar since May
    11TH, 2020.

    Upon discovery, CRD firm 8209 decided not to share, updated their
    premiums received as promoters and also swapped their CRD in the new
    improved disfunction under CIK filer 1516523.

    I believe JP Morgan was the custodian in the former, unsure who is
    responsible for those deposits and leverage risk as of current.

    FINRA, SEC, et al. Under the counsel of the Sarbanes of Oxley, I beg
    to differ those consequences beyond the damages as to set a
    Precedent, I once again invite this onto the Experts again, (e.g. a
    THIRD PARTY BUS OF OPINION) that are also Qualified, as am I.
