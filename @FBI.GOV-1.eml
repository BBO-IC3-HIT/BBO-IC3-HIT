Thank you for contacting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) Office of Inspector General (OIG).  The OIG is an independent 
office within the SEC that primarily audits internal SEC operations and 
investigates alleged SEC staff misconduct.  The OIG derives its 
authority from the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended.  In 
accordance with that statute, the OIG cannot perform SEC operating 
responsibilities, such as investigation of alleged securities law 
violations.  Further, the OIG has no authority to affect or overturn 
Commission decisions regarding whistleblower awards.



If your complaint relates to alleged SEC employee misconduct, please 
provide specific information or evidence to the OIG as follows:

(1) the identity of the employee(s) involved;

(2) the approximate date of the alleged misconduct;

(3) the specific nature of the alleged misconduct;

(4) the rules, regulations, or statutes that you allege the employee 
violated;

(5) the identity of other persons who might be aware of this alleged 
misconduct;

(6) the basis for your knowledge of the alleged misconduct;

(7) any documentary evidence of the alleged misconduct; and

(8) a statement regarding whether you (a) request confidentiality or (b) 
waive confidentiality (your name may be released to non-OIG personnel if 
an investigation is needed).





The OIG will evaluate your written complaint and determine an 
appropriate course of action.  Options include opening an OIG review 
(audit, evaluation or investigation); referring the matter to a SEC 
Division or Office for review and corrective action, if warranted; 
referring the matter to another Federal agency; or taking no action 
(allegations that do not involve a potential violation of law, rule, 
regulation, or policy as well as allegations with limited specificity or 
merit may be closed with no further action).  Due to privacy interests, 
we do not provide complainants with updates on, or the results of, 
complaints and/or investigative matters.



Please note that to request nonpublic information you must contact the 
SEC’s Office of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Services. For general 
information and instructions on how to request specific types of 
information, please visit www.sec.gov/foia.shtml.  If you have any 
questions, you may contact that office directly at 202-551-7900 or 
foiapa@sec.gov.



Respectfully,
