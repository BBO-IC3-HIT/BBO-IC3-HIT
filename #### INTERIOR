ATTN:    TO THE FAMILY & CO.

This Zucker family and their counselors decided to film the " interior of my apartment without my consent ";
    - then decided to distribute the videos without my consent.

    - I need a price, and i assume you all would know better than most.
    >  Also, i forgot where I left that contract in my apartment, the one on 57th behind the carnegie club - Mario left it somewhere and I lost that phone as well.

    >  He'll know EXACTLY which one I am talking about...

p.s. they wouldn't let me file a cross motion after i caught them on tax evasion so i let it shine on them like the stars on my ceiling.
        also, thanks again for dinner at philippe, in case i forgot to thank the extended family before I left...\
